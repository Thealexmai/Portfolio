          <h2>What I do</h2>
          <p>I am pursuing a double major in computer science and in business at the University of Rochester. I believe that my ability to speak and understand tech and business adds value to the things that I do. I seek to create tech solutions to solve business needs and problems. I love application development - whether it be on the web or on iOS, I love creating applications that are human-centered and have great user interface and design.</p>

        <div class="column2">
          <h2>What I love</h2>
          <p>I love to travel. I have been to 10 different states and four countries. I mostly visit New York City - everytime I'm there I explore a different spot. I also love to get my hands on the latest innovative technologies and experiment.</p>

          <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
          <p>I am from Honolulu, Hawaii. Although the state consists of mainly nine islands, I have only been to two. My goal is to explore each of the islands before permanently moving to the mainland.</p>
